            The Solar System is made up of the Sun and everything that orbits
            around it, including the eight planets, their moons, dwarf planets,
            asteroids, and comets. The Sun's gravity holds it all together,
            making it the center of the system. Closest to the Sun are the small
            rocky planets like Mercury, Venus, Earth, and Mars, while farther
            out lie the gas and ice giantsâ€”Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune.
            Beyond them stretch regions filled with icy bodies, such as the
            Kuiper Belt and the distant Oort Cloud.

              Jupiter is the fifth planet from the Sun and the largest in the
              Solar System. It is a gas giant with a mass nearly 2.5 times that
              of all the other planets in the Solar System combined and slightly
              less than one-thousandth the mass of the Sun.
